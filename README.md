# Rust_Programming for and from Dwayne Brock

My name is Milburn Dwayne Brock. I am an individual programmer.

I have had some undergraduate computer courses on C++ Object-oriented programming and computer information systems, 
but am primarily taught by a combination of those that have taken the time to tutor me and my experience at 
learning to write programs. I do hold a Computer IT certification from Google, but that does not teach programming.

This repository was created to explore and develop skills in Rust Programming. 
I truly believe Rust is the future of Programming. 
Time will tell if this is correct.

I am currently a beginner in Rust as of April 2022. I am close to intermediate skill in C-related languages.
These small programs  were intended to serve as personal learning aids.
If you find them useful I am glad for it.

Code presented in this repository is personally written, not cloned from another site.

Suggested sources for learning Rust:

  see the website https://www.rust-lang.org/.
  
  from this website, locate The Rust Book, Rust by Example, and The Rust Reference.
  Also the OReilly book Programming Rust by Blandy, Orendorff, and Tindall, 2nd Edition was very useful.
